"""PreToolUse hook: inject AGENTS.md files that Codex's own session-start
discovery does NOT cover.

Codex builds its instruction chain once per session by walking from the
project root down to the *initial* cwd only (see
codex-plugins/meta/skills/codex-memory/SKILL.md section 2). Files read or
edited outside that root->cwd path never get their local AGENTS.md
pulled in automatically -- unlike Claude Code's CLAUDE.md, which loads a
subdirectory's CLAUDE.md the moment Claude reads any file under it (see
claude-plugins/meta/skills/claude-code-memory/memory.md line 31), Codex
has no dedicated "Read" tool: apply_patch is the only structured
file-editing tool, and file reads normally go through arbitrary shell
commands (Bash / exec_command). This hook fires on apply_patch and Bash
calls, tries to work out which files/directories are actually being
touched (structured parsing for apply_patch, a best-effort heuristic
over common read commands for Bash), finds the AGENTS.override.md /
AGENTS.md files for their ancestor directories, skips whatever the
root->cwd walk already covered, and feeds the rest back in as
additionalContext.

The Bash-side detection is inherently a heuristic (arbitrary shell
commands can read files in ways this script won't recognize) and is not
a substitute for the deterministic apply_patch coverage.

Never blocks: on any error, it exits 0 with no output so the tool call
is unaffected.

This is the Codex adapter source. Copy the built file from
agent_tooling/hooks/generated/codex/nested_agents_md.py rather than running this module as a script
(relative imports). Cache dir is nested-agents-md-codex so it does not
collide with the live .codex/hooks/ script (codex-nested-agents-md).
