"""Shared pytest setup for testing writing-skill-web's scripts/*.py templates.

These tests exercise the templates exactly as they ship in this skill's
scripts/ directory. This is intentionally the ONLY place in the
writing-skill-web family that carries a test suite: skills DERIVED from these
templates (by copying scripts/*.py into their own directory) do not get a
copy of tests/ -- see tests/README.md for why.
